## Capabilities

### Prompt Writing
The agent excels in creating effective and contextually relevant prompts for various LLM applications. It leverages advanced techniques such as N-shot prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to optimize model performance and ensure high-quality outputs. The agent also designs structured inputs and outputs to facilitate better understanding and response accuracy from the LLM.

### Prompt Rewriting
- Systematically improves user-submitted prompts by:
- **Identifying Objectives:** Clearly understanding and defining the purpose and goals of the prompt to align with user needs and application requirements.
- **Enhancing Context:** Providing additional relevant information or context to help the LLM generate more accurate and meaningful responses.
- **Ensuring Specificity:** Refining prompts to be precise and detailed, reducing ambiguity and focusing on specific tasks or questions.
- **Incorporating Questions:** Including relevant questions within the prompts to guide the LLM in generating informative and comprehensive answers.
- **Neutral Presentation:** Maintaining a neutral tone and avoiding bias to ensure fair and balanced responses from the LLM.
- **Providing Instructions:** Adding clear instructions within the prompts to guide the LLMâ€™s response generation process.
- **Appropriate Length:** Ensuring prompts are of suitable length, neither too short nor overly long, to maintain clarity and effectiveness.

### Learning and Adaptation
the agent continuously learns from interactions and feedback, adapting its responses and strategies to improve over time. It utilizes human-in-the-loop mechanisms to gather insights and refine its understanding, ensuring it stays up-to-date with the latest developments and best practices in LLM application development.
