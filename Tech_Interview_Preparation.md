# Interview Preparation for Tech Roles

## 1. Software Developer/Engineer

### Technical Questions

1. **Object-Oriented vs. Functional Programming**
   - OOP: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, objects, classes.
   - FP: Pure functions, immutability, higher-order functions, recursion.

2. **Memory Management in Java/Python/C++**
   - Java: Garbage Collector.
   - Python: Automatic, reference counting, garbage collector.
   - C++: Manual, new/delete operators, smart pointers (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr).

3. **Reverse a Linked List**
   ```python
   class ListNode:
       def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
           self.val = val
           self.next = next

   def reverseLinkedList(head):
       prev = None
       current = head
       while current:
           next_node = current.next
           current.next = prev
           prev = current
           current = next_node
       return prev
   ```

4. **Optimize a Slow SQL Query**
   - Add indexes, use query hints, avoid SELECT *, refactor subqueries, ensure up-to-date statistics, consider table partitioning.

### Problem-Solving Questions

1. **Challenging Bug Resolution**
   - Memory leak in C++: Use tools like Valgrind, identify circular references, refactor code with smart pointers.

2. **Improving Sorting Algorithm Performance for Large Datasets**
   - Use efficient algorithms like QuickSort or MergeSort, optimize for cache usage, use external sorting techniques for very large datasets, consider Timsort or Radix Sort for specific cases.

3. **Approach to Debugging Complex Issues**
   - Reproduce issue, analyze logs, isolate problematic area, use debugging tools, check recent changes, consult documentation and colleagues, implement and test fixes.

### Behavioral Questions

1. **Project Team Experience**
   - Role: Backend development, API design, integration with front-end, code reviews, architectural design.

2. **Prioritizing Tasks with Multiple Deadlines**
   - Techniques: Eisenhower Matrix, communicate with stakeholders, time management tools.

3. **Disagreement on Technical Decision**
   - Example: Technology stack choice, organize a meeting, discuss pros and cons, consult team, proof-of-concept, reach consensus, maintain open communication.

## 2. Data Scientist

### Technical Questions

1. **Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning**
   - Supervised: Labeled data, regression, classification.
   - Unsupervised: No labels, clustering, PCA.

2. **Handling Missing Data**
   - Deletion, imputation (mean, median, mode, KNN, regression), predictive modeling, flagging missing data.

3. **Building a Machine Learning Model from Scratch**
   - Data collection, cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, deployment, monitoring.

4. **Overfitting and Prevention**
   - Simplify model, regularization (L1, L2), cross-validation, pruning, early stopping, increase training data.

### Problem-Solving Questions

1. **Identifying Important Features in a Dataset**
   - Feature importance from models, regularization, RFE, correlation analysis, PCA, domain knowledge.

2. **Cleaning and Preprocessing a Large Dataset**
   - Techniques: Imputation, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, normalization/scaling, outlier detection.

3. **Approaching a Customer Churn Prediction Project**
   - Define problem, collect data, clean and preprocess, feature engineering, EDA, model selection, training, evaluation, tuning, deployment, monitoring.

### Behavioral Questions

1. **Explaining Complex Data Insights to a Non-Technical Audience**
   - Simplify language, use visualizations, focus on impact, provide context.

2. **Staying Updated with Data Science Developments**
   - Read research papers, follow blogs/newsletters, take online courses, participate in communities, attend conferences/meetups.

3. **Successful Data Project and Impact**
   - Example: Predicting customer churn, identifying factors, developing retention strategies, reducing churn rate, increasing retention and revenue.

3. **Securing a Web Application Against SQL Injection and XSS**
   - SQL Injection: Parameterized queries, input validation, ORMs.
   - XSS: Input sanitization, CSP, output encoding, regular audits.

4. **Responding to a Ransomware Attack**
   - Isolate systems, identify ransomware, notify stakeholders, backup restoration, forensic investigation, patch/update, communication, review policies.

### Problem-Solving Questions

1. **Identifying and Addressing a Security Vulnerability**
   - Example: Authentication vulnerability, rate limiting, account lockout, MFA, user education.

2. **Performing a Risk Assessment for a New IT Project**
   - Identify assets, threats, assess vulnerabilities, evaluate impact, calculate risk levels, prioritize, implement controls, monitor and review.

3. **Actions in Case of a Data Breach**
   - Contain breach, assess impact, notify stakeholders, preserve evidence, forensic investigation, remediation, communicate with users, review and improve practices.

### Behavioral Questions
